    abstract={This paper describes a brief history of the research and development of information retrieval systems starting with the creation of electromechanical searching devices, through to the early adoption of computers to search for items that are relevant to a user's query. The advances achieved by information retrieval researchers from the 1950s through to the present day are detailed next, focusing on the process of locating relevant information. The paper closes with speculation on where the future of information retrieval lies.},
